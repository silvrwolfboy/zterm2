------------------------------

Provide you with the ability to send files using your terminal between
machines. It's slower then scp but very convenient.

You neeed to instal zmodem on the remote machines.
For ubuntu/debian: ```apt-get install lrzsz```

Setup is pretty simple:

1. Run ```./install.sh```
2. Set up Triggers (Open Profiles->Edit Profies->Profiles->Advanced) in iTerm 2 like so:

### Send trigger
<pre>
    Regex: \*\*B0100
    Action: Run Silent Coprocess
    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/ziterm2-send.sh
</pre>
### Recv trigger
<pre>
    Regex: \*\*B00000000000000
    Action: Run Silent Coprocess
    Parameters: /usr/local/bin/ziterm2-recv.sh
</pre>

### Expected result
